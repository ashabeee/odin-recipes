            <li>1 tbsp neutral cooking oil</li>
            <li>6 cups thickly sliced cremini mushrooms</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, crush the bouillon cube and mix it with the salt. Spread it on top of the skin of the chicken thighs.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the oil and cook the chicken thighs on high heat until the skin is nicely browned. Don't worry about fully cooking it at this step. Once the skin is golden, set it aside on a plate.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to med-high, add the butter to the chicken fat, and add the mushrooms. Leave them until they are golden brown on one side, then flip and do the same on the other sides. Once they are all browned, add the minced garlic and thyme, add salt and pepper to taste, cook for 30 seconds, then add the coconut cream. </li>
            <li>Add the chicken back to the pan, simmer on med-low for 15-20 mins, until the chicken thighs are fully cooked and the sauce is thickened. Serve on a bed of mixed rice.</li>
        </ol>
